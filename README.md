# This is an implementation of  [RFC 6902 JSON Patch](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) written in Java.

## Description & Use-Cases
- Java Library to find / apply JSON Patches according to [RFC 6902](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902).
- JSON Patch defines a JSON document structure for representing changes to a JSON document.
- It can be used to avoid sending a whole document when only a part has changed, thus reducing network bandwidth requirements if data (in JSON format) is required to send across multiple systems over network or in case of multi DC transfer.
- When used in combination with the HTTP PATCH method as per [RFC 5789 HTTP PATCH](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789), it will do partial updates for HTTP APIs in a standard  way.


### Compatible with : Java 6 and above all versions

## Code Coverage
Package      |	Class, % 	 |  Method, % 	   |  Line, %           |
-------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------------|
all classes  |	100% (6/ 6)  |	93.6% (44/ 47) |  96.2% (332/ 345)  |

## Complexity
- To find JsonPatch : Ω(N+M) ,N and M represents number of keys in first and second json respectively / O(summation of la*lb) where la , lb represents JSON array of length la / lb of against same key in first and second JSON ,since LCS is used to find difference between 2 JSON arrays there of order of quadratic.
- To Optimize Diffs ( compact move and remove into Move ) : Ω(D) / O(D*D) where D represents number of diffs obtained before compaction into Move operation.
- To Apply Diff : O(D) where D represents number of diffs

## API Usage

### Obtaining JSON Diff as patch
```xml
JsonNode patch = JsonDiff.asJson(JsonNode source, JsonNode target)
```
Computes and returns a JSON `patch` from `source`  to `target`,
Both `source` and `target` must be either valid JSON objects or arrays or values. 
Further, if resultant `patch` is applied to `source`, it will yield `target`.

The algorithm which computes this JsonPatch currently generates following operations as per [RFC 6902](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) - 
 - `add`
 - `remove`
 - `replace`
 - `move`
 - `copy`

### Apply Json Patch
```xml
JsonNode target = JsonPatch.apply(JsonNode patch, JsonNode source);
```
Given a `patch`, it apply it to `source` JSON and return a `target` JSON which can be ( JSON object or array or value ). This operation  performed on a clone of `source` JSON ( thus, the `source` JSON is unmodified and can be used further). 

## To turn off MOVE & COPY Operations
```xml
EnumSet<DiffFlags> flags = DiffFlags.dontNormalizeOpIntoMoveAndCopy().clone()
JsonNode patch = JsonDiff.asJson(JsonNode source, JsonNode target, flags)
```

### Example
First Json
```json
{"a": 0,"b": [1,2]}
```

Second json ( the json to obtain )
```json
 {"b": [1,2,0]}
```
Following patch will be returned:
```json
[{"op":"move","from":"/a","path":"/b/2"}]
```
here `"op"` specifies the operation (`"move"`), `"from"` specifies the path from where the value should be moved, and  `"path"` specifies where value should be moved. The value that is moved is taken as the content at the `"from"` path.

### Apply Json Patch In-Place
```xml
JsonPatch.applyInPlace(JsonNode patch, JsonNode source);
```
Given a `patch`, it will apply it to the `source` JSON mutating the instance, opposed to `JsonPatch.apply` which returns 
a new instance with the patch applied, leaving the `source` unchanged.

### Tests:
1. 100+ selective hardcoded different input JSONs , with their driver test classes present under /test directory.
2. Apart from selective input, a deterministic random JSON generator is present under ( TestDataGenerator.java ),  and its driver test class method is JsonDiffTest.testGeneratedJsonDiff().


#### *** Tests can only show presence of bugs and not their absence ***
